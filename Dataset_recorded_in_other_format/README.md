# Note
We provide the collected ruthenium-catalyzed C-H functionalization dataset recorded in other format for the training using other models for site-selectivity task,
 including on-the-fly QM-GNN (Guan, Y. et al. Chem. Sci., 2021, 12, 2198) and stomistic GNN3D (Nippa, D. F. et al. Nat. Chem. 2024, 16, 239).
