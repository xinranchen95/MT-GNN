# Note
The DG and RX referred to two reaction substrates arene and electrophile, respectively. The cdx files provide ChemDraw structures for all arenes and electrophiles included in the dataset.
The csv files for arene (DG.csv) and electrophile (RX.csv) contain the molecular properties of these two substrates. The train_DG folder and train_RX folder contain MOL files for all the arenes and electrophiles.
The reactions are recorded in the format of SMILES in dataset.csv with the corresponding reaction performance and source publication.
