# Note
The DG and RX referred to two reaction substrates arene and electrophile, respectively. The cdx files show all the arenes and electrophiles involved in the dataset.
The csv files for arene and electrophile contain the molecular properties of these two substrates. The train_DG folder and train_RX folder contain the MOL files for all the arenes and electrophiles.
