This is a repository for the paper entitled "Integrating Multi-Task Graph Neural Network and DFT Calculations for Site-Selectivity Prediction of Arenes and Mechanistic Knowledge Generation"
# Introduction
A multi-task learning graph neural network was developed to predict the site-selectivity of ruthenium-catalyzed C-H functionalization of arenes. The dataset was collected manually including 241 individual reactions. The site-selectivity classification task is optimized alongside with two molecular property regression tasks of reaction components (arene and electrophile). For a better reaction representation, the reaction graphs are informed with previous mechanistic insights. Two additional test set (experimental and out-of-sample test) were prepared to validate the extrapolative ability of the MT-GNN model.
